    <h1>Turbulence Modelling with Artificial Neural Networks</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      During my MEng in Mechanical at Imperial College London, I explored the
      potential of applying artificial neural networks (ANNs) for turbulence
      modelling under the supervision of <a href="">Dr. Salvador Navarro-Martinez</a>
      and alongside a classmate, Alvaro Prat Balasch. <br>

    <h2> <u> Summary </u> </h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Turbulence in fluid dynamics, described as “the most important unsolved problem
      of classical physics” by physicist Richard Feynman in 1964 -who’s quote is still
      relevant today- is a particular case of a greater concept called deterministic chaos.
      Turbulence arises in a wide range of fluid flows: from flows around cars and aeroplanes
      to greater geophysical scales such as ocean currents or atmospheric flows. <br>
      <br>
      The dynamics of these flows are described by the partial differential Navier-Stokes equations.
      These equations can be solved numerically for specific types of flows, but are
      computationally expensive and unviable for highly turbulent flows. <br>
      <br>
      A method called Large Eddy Simulations (LES) spatially averages
      the Navier-Stokes equation to resolve only the large scales of motion of the flows,
      reducing the compurational power required.However, the averaging process gives rise to
      an additional stress component which incorporates small-scale terms of motion and must be modelled.

        The spatially averaged Navier-Stokes. The terms correspond to the usual
        meanings in the field of Fluid Dynamics which will not be discussed here.
        The term circled in red is the residual stress term which must be modelled
        to predict the fluid's motion.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
      <br>
      In our research, we model the residual stress term using ANNs and features
      from the large scales of motions, such as the flow velocity or the
      velocity gradient in space. The residual stress term being non-linear, hence the
      ability of ANNs to model non-linear functions suggested its potential in
      closing the filtered Navier-Stokes Equations.  <br>
      <br>
      Using similar features, we obtained correlation coefficeints superior to various classical turbulence
      models, for different types of turbulent flows: Homegenous Isotropic Turbulence,
      Buoyancy driven flows, Magnetohydrodyanmic flows, Channel Flows.

        Example of the predictions of a residual stress term on a plane of a
        buoyancy mixing turbulent flow. A correlation coefficient of 0.92 between predicted
        and exact terms for such flows. The model manages to learn a model to
        predict the small scale residual stress term from large scales of motion
        features.
